# INSOFE-Project-Repository

This is the repository of all the projects i did for INSOFE which includes the final project hackathon and the mid course hackathon.
The mid course hackathon was to predict the Singapore housing resale prices. Since the project was submitted to the institutes portal the score i got was online.There is copy of the code in my repository. In which the model submission part is not excecuted.
